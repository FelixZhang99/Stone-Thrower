# Stone-Thrower

Hi, admission officer!

You must reach this section by reviewing the github url link that I provide. 
I sincerely appreciate the effort that you put into every applicant.

This is the second game that I developed. 
Please don't be scared by the Chinese filename.
The one without any suffix will direct you to my codes.
I am sorry that I cannot republish the game in English on app store because I lost the original images of the game.
I will be appreciate if you are willing to read my codes.

Sincerely,
Futian Zhang
